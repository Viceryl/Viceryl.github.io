This particuler wod was fairly straight forward it mostly contaied coping and pasting straight from the instruction. All you needed to know was where to copy the code to in the file.
To prepare completed the WOD once and watched the video walkthrough. this is roughly the same as I do for other WODS
Next time I might try to complete the WOD entirly without watching any of the videos
