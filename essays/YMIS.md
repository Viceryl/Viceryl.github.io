I chose MIS mostly by accident. When I first entered UH I had no clue at all about what degree I wanted to pursue. After following the guidance of my brother, who is also in shidler, I ended up takeing Business pre-requisites and admitting to shidler. I chose MIS out of all the business degrees because after doing some research I felt the MIS would be the most useful for me when searching for a career. An MIS degree can lead to fairly high earings and has a fast growth rate in terms of job opportunity. I also really liked the versitility of MIS, as someone who still doesn't really nave a post graduation dream, I felt like the MIS would keep my job options open and provide a broadly useful knowledge base. It is clear to me that in this progressivly digital society being technologically literate is not only useful professionally but also personally beneficial.
